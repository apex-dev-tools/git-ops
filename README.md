# git-ops

Library to do git operations to find changed files in a given git repository.

## Â Usage

**Prerequisite**: The head mus tbe set on the repo otherwise any functions using default branch will fail

### Diff by ref

The output of the command is same as running `git diff branchName...ref` combined with `git status`.

**Note:** files with the status of deleted (`D`) and ignored (`!`) will not be included in the change set.
